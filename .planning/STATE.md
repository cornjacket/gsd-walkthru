# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** A backend developer integrating any supported webhook provider can validate signatures correctly with one line of middleware — with replay protection where the provider supports it, and documented honesty about where it doesn't.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-tooling

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Stripe implemented before GitHub/Shopify so the richest provider (signed timestamp + multi-segment header) forces the abstraction; simpler providers then validate the shape.
- Roadmap: `WebhookValidationError` (API-02) sits in Phase 2 with crypto rather than Phase 3 with the rest of the public API, because every provider phase depends on throwing structured errors.
- Roadmap: Tests (Phase 6) and docs/example (Phase 7) are split — tests gate functional quality, docs gate portfolio polish; bundling them would hide either signal.
